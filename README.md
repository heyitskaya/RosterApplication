# RosterApplication
This is an application used to track registered and waitlisted students for a class. 
It uses a doubly linked list to keep track, add and delete students.
When we add students to the class, if the class is not full, it will add the students in alphabetical order. 
When we add students to the waitlist, we add it in chronological order using a queue.
